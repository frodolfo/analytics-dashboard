Front-end Style Guide
=====================

Feel free to use any of the styling from the meez web app if you see fit and/or
feel it would work better than the below.

Layout
------

There is no need to worry about a footer or a header for the page. All the page
needs to display is the grid of 6 metrics.

Each metric should have a title and a value. Each metric should display as a
white box with gray border. Look at the Concepts page (in the meez web app) for
example of similar styling.

Itâ€™s up to you how many metrics to display in each row (on desktop and mobile).
